#### The goal was to have 3 'players' connect to a server where each player can be moved by clicking on them, then pressing an arrow key on the keyboard.

#### After moving the player will update their coordinates to the other players using an emitter event via the server.

`npm install` should be executed on the client and server parts of the app.

`npm run start` in each folder should be sufficient to run the client and the server. Server may need `sudo npm run start`.

Please check the console logs and terminal logs for output data.
